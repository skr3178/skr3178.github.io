# Eureka: Human-Level Reward Design via Coding Large Language Models (ICLR 2024)

<div align="center">

# Installation
Eureka requires Python ≥ 3.8. We have tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.

1. Create a new conda environment with:
    ```
    conda create -n eureka python=3.8
    conda activate eureka
    ```

2. Install IsaacGym (tested with `Preview Release 4/4`). Follow the [instruction](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) to download the package.
```	
tar -xvf IsaacGym_Preview_4_Package.tar.gz
cd isaacgym/python
pip install -e .
(test installation) python examples/joint_monkey.py
```

3. Install Eureka
```
git clone https://github.com/eureka-research/Eureka.git
cd Eureka; pip install -e .
cd isaacgymenvs; pip install -e .
cd ../rl_games; pip install -e .
```

4. Eureka currently uses OpenAI API for language model queries. You need to have an OpenAI API key to use Eureka [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)/. Then, set the environment variable in your terminal
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY= "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

# Getting Started

Navigate to the `eureka` directory and run:
```
python eureka.py env={environment} iteration={num_iterations} sample={num_samples}
```
- `{environment}` is the task to perform. Options are listed in `eureka/cfg/env`.
- `{num_samples}` is the number of reward samples to generate per iteration. Default value is `16`.
- `{num_iterations}` is the number of Eureka iterations to run. Default value is `5`.


Below are some example commands to try out Eureka:
```
python eureka.py env=shadow_hand sample=4 iteration=2 model=gpt-4-0314
```
```
python eureka.py env=humanoid sample=16 iteration=5 model=gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613
```
Each run will create a timestamp folder in `eureka/outputs` that saves the Eureka log as well as all intermediate reward functions and associated policies.

Other command line parameters can be found in `eureka/cfg/config.yaml`. The list of supported environments can be found in `eureka/cfg/env`.

# Eureka Pen Spinning Demo
We have released Eureka pen spinning policy in `isaacgymenvs/isaacgymenvs/checkpoints`. Try visualizing it with the following command:
```
cd isaacgymenvs/isaacgymenvs
python train.py test=True headless=False force_render=True task=ShadowHandSpin checkpoint=checkpoints/EurekaPenSpinning.pth
```
Note that this script use the default Isaac Gym renderer and not the Omniverse rendering in the paper videos.

# Running Eureka on a New Environment
1. Create a new IsaacGym environment; instructions can be found in [here](isaacgymenvs/docs/framework.md).
2. Verify that standard RL works for your new environment.
```
cd isaacgymenvs/isaacgymenvs
python train.py task=YOUR_NEW_TASK
```
3. Create a new yaml file `your_new_task.yaml` in `eureka/cfg/env`:
```
env_name: your_new_task
task: YOUR_NEW_TASK 
description: ...
```
4. Construct the raw environment code that will serve as context for Eureka as well as the skeleton environment code on which the Eureka reward will be appended to:
```
cd eureka/utils
python prune_env.py your_new_task
```

5. Try out Eureka!
```
python eureka.py env=your_new_task
```

## SKR Notes

- Solved the issues with better prompts at all stages. 
- Out of memory error with cuda also resolved using cache of NVIDIA memory. 
- In addition, the analysis does not run in parallel but only after one simulation is completed. 
- ToDo: Compare the results from default rewards with the LLM predicts rewards for 
1. Humanoid
2. Hand Motion
