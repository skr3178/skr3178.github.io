## Research Proposal: Dexterity-Based Hand Motion Model

### Concept
Similar to human motion diffusion models, can there be a dexterity-based hand model?
The dexterity of the human hand is high and creating reward functions is cumbersome, requiring sparse rewards.

### Data Collection Strategy
Use motion capture datasets from motion detection gloves such as 'MANUS' to create a massive glove/hand dataset. 
Examples for the motion capture dataset could include applications such as cooking, playing piano, guitar, etc.

Fine-tune the model on YouTube videos that show first-person hand movements → 
extract the motion data from them → refine it in Blender → retarget it for specific hand URDF models.

### Expected Outcome
This way one can have an open foundation model for dexterity-based hand motion only.

Running on iOS iphone 12 simulator

Functions with some lag and accuracy issues
Frames/sec of the video is higher than the inference rate of the model @ 22 Hz

Need a better performance model
App works on photos, videos and live strema feed

As of now, mediapipe hosts only one model for hand pose detection. 
The training data is not available publicly. However, the metadata is. 
Alternatives exists which are opensource. However not yet been explored in this project. 

Here, they use additional information, to better estimate the hand tracking from monocular dataset.
